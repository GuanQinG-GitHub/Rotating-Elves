After taking QFD analysis about this project, we divide the whole project into four individual systems:  driving, remoting, launching and reloading. Learning from the classical mechanical model and state-of-the-art technology, we design this omni-motion, Bluetooth-remote-control and self-reloading  automatic catapult. In this report, we discuss the designing process in detail, from the concept design  using QFD method, to the prototypes of different system, experimental results &amp; performance  evaluation, discussion about the final product, the cost estimation about the whole procedure and the  conclusion on the project. In the end, we also list all the references we cite, the nomenclature used in  this report, and the acknowledge of this project. All other related works are attached in the appendix. Key words: QFD method, omni-motion, Bluetooth remote, lever-spring catapult, turbine-based reloading.</p> <p>Click here to download the pdf form of our report</p>"},{"location":"Automatic_Catapult/#poster","title":"Poster","text":"<p>Click here to download the pdf form of our Expo Poster</p>"},{"location":"Automatic_Catapult/#video-demo","title":"Video Demo","text":"<p>Check the Video Demo produced by SharpShooter in the Best Awarded Team posted by the Wechat Public Account of Shien-Ming Wu School of Intelligent Engineering.

This project aims to design a hand exoskeleton which assists people suffer from hand diseases to rehabilitate and supports their daily requirements on hands. This project can be divided into two parts as actuation system and sensing system. We design the bionic anchors, manufactrue them using 3-D printer and attach them to the glove. These anchors are used to fix the tendons connected to motors. 10 motors are used to fully actuate the hand exoskeleton while each finger is controlled by 2 motors, for fexion and extension respectively. Flex sensors are used to measure the bending extent of each finger and the gesture information of the hand can be reflected by the measurement from 5 flex sensors. Hence, closed-loop gesture control can be achieved, where we use the hand exoskeleton to actuate the hand with disease to mimic the gesture of other healthy hand, which can be used to support the rehabilitation process. Based on the bending extent measurements, we also add safety insurances to avoid harmful gestures.
