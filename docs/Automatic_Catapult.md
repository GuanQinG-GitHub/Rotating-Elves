## Report
### Abstract
This project is mainly designed to finish all the tasks proposed in the requirementsâ€”remotely control the catapult to launch different balls in some specific points with automatic reloading. 
After taking QFD analysis about this project, we divide the whole project into four individual systems: 
driving, remoting, launching and reloading. Learning from the classical mechanical model and state-of-the-art technology, we design this omni-motion, Bluetooth-remote-control and self-reloading 
automatic catapult. In this report, we discuss the designing process in detail, from the concept design 
using QFD method, to the prototypes of different system, experimental results & performance 
evaluation, discussion about the final product, the cost estimation about the whole procedure and the 
conclusion on the project. In the end, we also list all the references we cite, the nomenclature used in 
this report, and the acknowledge of this project. All other related works are attached in the appendix.
Key words: QFD method, omni-motion, Bluetooth remote, lever-spring catapult, turbine-based reloading.
